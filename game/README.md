# Shadow Wizard Money Gang



## Overview
We are making a "survivors-like" game as our project for iti0301-2024. It will be featuring familiar to many gameplay, but with the added twist of having multiplayer co-op.

## Our goal
Our goal is to have fun making the game and getting used to working with Git.

## How to play

To start the game, click the "Play" button, and to exit the game, click the "Exit" button. If you select "Play", the mode selection screen will appear.

If singleplayer mode is selected:
The game will start immediately.

If multiplayer mode is selected:
You will be taken to a waiting room and wait for the second player.

#### The game begins:
The player appears on the field, where monsters immediately begin to run and attack the player. Using the arrows(←, →, ↑, ↓) you can control your character and run away from monsters. To shoot and kill monsters, you need to point the cursor at the enemy and click on the mouse. If you successfully hit, the enemy's health will decrease, and when the enemy dies, you will gain points and level up. For reaching a new level you will receive a bonus in the form of a skill improvement. To exit the game, press the "Escape" key.

#### End of game in singleplayer mode:
If you run out of health, the Game Over screen will appear with the option to start over or quit the game.

#### End of game in multiplayer mode:
The first player will see a "You Lose" screen, and the second player will automatically see a "You Win" screen. Each of them has a button to return to the menu and exit the game.
